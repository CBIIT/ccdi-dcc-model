property	description
UMI_barcode_offset	The offset in sequence of the UMI identifying barcode. E.g. "16".
UMI_barcode_read	Unique molecular identifier; added at cell isolation or library construction step. Determines which transcript molecule the read originated from.
UMI_barcode_size	The size of the UMI identifying barcode. E.g. "10".
acl	A free text field used to document whether the data in a repository is open access or controlled access. If access to the data are unrestricted, the acl field should be listed [“*]. Controlled access should be denoted as a comma delimited list of phs accession numbers, for example, [“phs000123] or [“phs000123,phs000124].
acquisitionContrastCode	Text specifying the kind of contrast used during the imaging acquisition process.
adult_or_childhood_study	The identifiable class of the study participant based upon their age.
adverse_event	Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 Low Level Term Name
age_at_diagnosis	Age at the time of diagnosis expressed in number of days since birth.
age_at_event_free_survival_status	Time from diagnosis to first event (or censoring), in days.
age_at_exposure	The age (in days) of subject at a known exposure to a hazardous factor or substance.
age_at_genetic_analysis	The age in days of the subject at the time of the genetic analysis.
age_at_laboratory_test	The age (in days) of the subject when the molecular test was performed.
age_at_last_known_survival_status	The age (in days) of the subject when the vitals measurement was taken.
age_at_response	The age (in days) of subject when the response assessment was made.
age_at_treatment_end	Subject Age in Days at End of Treatment Course Day Count
age_at_treatment_start	Subject Age in Days at Start of Treatment Course Day Count
alcohol_days_per_week	Numeric value used to describe the average number of days each week that a person consumes an alcoholic beverage.
alcohol_drinks_per_day	Numeric value used to describe the average number of alcoholic beverages a person consumes per day.
alcohol_intensity	Category to describe the patient's current level of alcohol use as self-reported by the patient.
